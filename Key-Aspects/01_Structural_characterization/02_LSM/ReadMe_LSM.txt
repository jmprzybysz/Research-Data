______About the dataset______
LSM analysis was performed by: 
* Joanna Przybysz
* ORCID: 0009-0000-8402-5691
* Helmholtz Institute Erlangen-Nürnberg for Renewable Energy
* Cauerstraße 1, 91058 Erlangen, Germany 

______Methods of data collection______
LSM images were recorded using a Keyence VK-X250 device.
Images of ML overviews and individual spots were recorded with 5x magnification in assembly mode. For shape profile measurements, 20x magnification was used for improved accuracy.

______Methods of data processing______
Shape profiles: X-coordinate unit change (µm to mm)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
______File formats______
Images: exported to .png
Profiles: .txt 

______Abbreviations______
n.a.

______Units______
Image scale bars in µm
Profiles in mm (x-coord.) and µm (z-coord.)
