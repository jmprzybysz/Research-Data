With the growing interest of the electrochemical community in high-throughput (HT) experimentation as a powerful tool in accelerating materials discovery, the implementation of HT methodologies and the design of HT workflows has gained traction. We identify 6 aspects essential to HT workflow design in electrochemistry and beyond to ease the incorporation of HT methods in the community’s research and to assist in their improvement. We study IrCo mixed-metal oxides (MMOs) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media using the mentioned aspects to provide a practical example of possible workflow design pitfalls and strategies to counteract them. 

______Methods of data collection______
XPS spectra:
Conventional XPS system (SPECS Surface Nano Analysis, GmbH Germany) with ultrahigh vacuum chamber equipped with a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) and a multichannel electron energy analyzer (SPECS Phoibos 150) with 1D-DLD detector.

______Methods of data processing______
The data were corrected on the binding energy of C 1s to 284.2 eV.
